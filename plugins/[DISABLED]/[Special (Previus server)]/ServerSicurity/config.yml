# This is an advanced protection mode, it will deop and remove any permissions that could be dangerous, if your account get stealed.
# The plugin will remove the op and the * and set the owners of the server every time they join and quit to the default group.
# If you are the really owner of the server you have to type /security and it will generate a random key in console.
# You have to copy that key, and do /security key <key> . The plugin will give you back all the permissions and also the op.
# You also need a permissions to do /security the permission is "security.main", so what I recommend is create a group whit only this permissions.
AdvancedProtection:
    # Set this "true" if you want active this protection.
    enable: true
    # You have to set only one to true! If you are using PermissionsEx set like this: "PermissionsEx: true".
    # If you are using a permissions plugin manager that not appear on this list, let me know on the discord server.
