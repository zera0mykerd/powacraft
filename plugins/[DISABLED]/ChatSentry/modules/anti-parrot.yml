# Intelligent Anti Parrot:
# Prevents players using hacked clients to automatically copy ("parrot") other players chat messages. Also prevents the same (non-generic) message from be said by multiple players within a short time frame.

# Should the module utilize extra intelligence algorithms? Keeping this on is highly recommended. Typically having this on extends compatibility to detect players using premium / smarter hacked clients.
intelligent: true

# If true, short messages such as "lol" or "xD" will be ignored and not detected as parroting if multiple players repeat them in a short time frame.
# Note that this only applies to VERY short messages like the examples mentioned above.
ignore-short: true

# If using ignore-short, the below list is in almost all cases not necessary.

# The phrases below are phrases that the module will ignore, and can be said by multiple players within a short time frame.
# Character case in the below list does NOT matter. Case variants are automatically checked by the plugin.
# Set to "phrase-whitelist: []" to have an empty list.
phrase-whitelist:
- "wb"
- "welcome back"
- "wbbb"
- "weba"
- "yes"
- "yea"
- "ok"
- "sure"
- "no"
- "nope"
- "nah"
- "yup"
- "yep"
- "yeh"

# How similar must a message be to a phrase on the list above to be considered the same and also whitelisted? (in %)
# 1.0 = exactly as one of the phrases on the list (excluding character case)
# 0.0 = not exact at all (this eliminates the purpose of the whitelist)
