# Anti Statue Spambot:
# Prevents joining players abilities to send messages or commands until they move in order to protect against basic artificially controlled spam bots. Has an optional command whitelist. Does not require "process-commands" in the main config to be enabled to function.
# Bypass permission: "chatsentry.antistatuespambot.bypass"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you have plugins that make players run commands when they join, add those commands below so they aren't blocked by ChatSentry.
# Make sure to only include base commands; don't add any command arguments (spaces).
# Set to "join-command-whitelist: []" to have an empty list.
