# Intelligent Spam Blocker:
# Prevents players from repeating the same or similar messages over and over within a short period of time. The more times a player attempts to repeat a message when it's already being blocked, the longer before they will be able to repeat themselves again, creating a dynamic and infinitely expanding block period that will disallow spam bots trying to repeat the same messages over and over for long durations of time.

# The phrases below are phrases that the spam blocker will ignore, and can be said over and over.
# Character case in the below list does NOT matter. Case variants are automatically checked by the plugin.
# Set to "phrase-whitelist: []" to have an empty list.
phrase-whitelist:
- "wb"
- "welcome back"
- "wbbb"
- "weba"
- "yes"
- "yea"
- "ok"
- "sure"
- "no"
- "nope"
- "nah"
- "yup"
- "yep"
- "yeh"

# How similar must a message be to a phrase on the list above to be allowed through? (in %)
# 1.0 = exactly as one of the phrases on the list (excluding character case)
# 0.0 = not exact at all (this eliminates the purpose of the whitelist)
phrase-whitelist-similarity-threshold: 0.65

# If a player's message isn't similar to one of the messages on the phrase-whitelist, the below threshold value is used.

# How similar must a player's current message be to their last message(s) within the repeat-cooldown-in-seconds period in order to be blocked?
#
# 1.0 = message will be blocked only if it's exactly (100%) the same as one of their previous messages within the repeat-cooldown-in-seconds period.
# 0.0 = message needs to be 0% similar to their last message(s) within the repeat-cooldown-in-seconds period in order to be blocked. (this eliminates the purpose of the similarity checker)
block-repeated-message-similarity-threshold: 0.82

# This is how many times a player can repeat any messages they said within the last (roughly) repeat-cooldown-in-seconds period of time before being blocked for spam (messages on or similar to the phrase-whitelist will be ignored).
allowed-repeats: 4

# How long after a player sends a message should the module forget that a player said the message? (and allow them to repeat it or a similar message again)
repeat-cooldown-in-seconds: 15

# IMPORTANT: The below list will only work if "process-commands" is true in config.yml
# The below list is which commands the module will apply to. It's recommended to only set these to your private messaging commands.
# Set the list to "affected-commands: []" to apply the module to ALL commands (highly not recommended!)
# Make sure to only include base commands; don't add any command arguments. (spaces)
affected-commands:
- "/tell"
- "/t"
- "/msg"
- "/w"
- "/r"
- "/whisper"
- "/w"
- "/pm"
