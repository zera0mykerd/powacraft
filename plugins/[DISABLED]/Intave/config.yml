# Intave config (Generated by Intave Anti-Cheat 12.5.5)
#
# This is the configuration of intave. Here you can adjust intave the way you want it to behave and react to threats.
# If you have any troubles, please open an issue at "https://intave.de/go/issues"
# This config is based on the configuration of AAC (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6442/)
#
#    Introduction
#
#      IMPORTANT - You need to reload or restart your server in order to apply changes made in this configuration.
#
#      Intave has "checks" that check for specific cheats used by cheaters, hackers, spammers and other bad bad guys.
#      Flight checks for example will only prevent players from flying and knockback checks will only check if a player gets proper knockback
#      All available checks and all of their settings are listed below.
#
#      The "enabled" option in each check defines, if intave should use this check.
#      It can be disabled if you are not comfortable with the check.
#
#      If a check determines a threat, it is called a "flag".
#      These checks might not be 100% correct and they sometimes flag normal or legitimate players (in case of exteme lag for example).
#      In order to prevent false kicks/bans, every check has a Violation Level or VL (for every player) that will be increased
#      every time a "check" does "flag" a player. The higher the VL, the more certain it is, that a player is cheating/violating a check by using unwanted modifications.
#      The proportions vary from check to check.
#
#      Example:
#         Flight          at VL 1 does mean a player might be glitching and is not necessarily cheating.
#         Heuristics      at VL 1 does mean a player is very likely to cheat
#         IllegalRotation at VL 1 does mean a player is 100% cheating
#
#      Please note that not all checks are used to kick cheaters.
#      IllegalAbilites for example are not primarly used for kicking. If a player tries to regenerate faster than usual, he will be flagged and kicked for "move", since sending
#      more movement packets will cause a faster regeneration. But the IllegalAbilites is still used and important, since having an overall check, that limits the regeneration speed is still important.
#      In order to prevent cheating - for example flying -, intave needs to block/setback the player detected.
#      The option "cancel_vl" defines the violation level where intave should start to block/setback the cheat attempt.
#
#      Example:
#         Legit
#             1. FLIGHT FLAG (VL 13)(+13) < 35[default "cancel_vl" for flight] -> No setback, player does not recognize flag, because 13 is smaller than the "cancel_vl" value of 35
#
#         Cheating
#             1. FLIGHT FLAG (VL 40)(+40) > 35[default "cancel_vl" for flight] -> Cheat attempt will setback, because 40 is greater than the "cancel_vl" value of 35
#             2. FLIGHT FLAG (VL 80)(+40) > 35[default "cancel_vl" for flight] -> Second cheat attempt will also setback, because (40[first attempt] + 40[second attempt]) or 80 is greater than the "cancel_vl" value of 35
#
#      The higher the "cancel_vl" is set, the less likely normal players are setbacked and the more cheaters can cheat without being setbacked.
#      In order to turn off setbacks (silent config), set the "cancel_vl" for each check to a unreachable positive numeric value.
#
#      The "vl_reduce_time" option defines how long intave should wait before reduceing a players violation level until it finally reaches zero again.
#
#      If a player has reached a certain violation level, intave will execute given commands in this configuration file, so you can kick the player or alert your staff members.
#      Intave has a built-in staff notification system. "/matrix notify {message}" will send a notification message (layout can be changed at the bottom of intaves configuration) to every player with access to IntavePermission.ADMIN_NOTIFY (or "intave.admin.notify")
#      Since every check has its own violation level, it would only be fair to give every check a custom thresholds selection.
#      This example should help you to understand and use the command execution system
#
#      Example (config snippet taken from flight check)
#
#          thresholds:
#             500: "matrix notify %playername% might be using fly"                                 # Player reached VL 500 at this check. -> Staff Notification
#             900:                                                                                  # Player reached VL 900 at this check. All following commands will be executed
#             - "matrix notify %playername% was removed from the game due to suspicious movements" #  -> Staff Notification
#             - "matrix kick %playername% %prefix% Moved wrongly"                                          #  -> Kicks cheater for "[Intave] Moved wrongly"
#             - "matrix notify &c%playername% &7was kicked for &4cheating"                       #  -> Broadcasts message to all players online.
#
#      The values can be set to almost any positive value. Please keep in mind, that muliple commands might not be executed in the correct order. (I still don't know exacly why)
#
#      If you want to see the "flags", simply type "/iac verbose" in chat. You need IntavePermission.COMMAND_USE (or "intave.command") to access the main intave command and IntavePermission.ADMIN_VERBOSE (or "intave.admin.verbose") to access the verbose subcommand.
#
#      In order to print and save this stream of violations, turn on "file_log" at the bottom of the configuration.
#      All violations should - after a quick and easy server restart - be saved and logged        in a file located in <server-jar>/plugins/Intave/logs/
#      In case an error occurs - even without the "file_log" option - , it is automatically saved in a file located in <server-jar>/plugins/Intave/errors/
#
#    The Intave API
#
#      Intave uses simple bukkit events if it flags a player or executes a command.
#      All commands you want to give to intave are handled by an access api.
#      Get it via IntaveAPIAccessGate.getAPIReflector()
