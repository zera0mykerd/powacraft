AVVERTENZA: [CasualProtector] We detected that you use ViaVersion! This plugin is changing some packets (for example: BlockPlacePacket) and some players can bypass anticrash if you will not remove the plugin, just informing. I'm going to create my own fork (version) of ViaVersion soon to fix these problems, it's the problem of ViaVersion, not CProtector, because of ViaVersion, Cprotector doesn't get real packets.
