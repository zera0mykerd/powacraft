# Use the following format for adding new groups:
# group-name:
#     display-name: 'My Amazing Group'
#     gui-icon: 'ENDER_CHEST'
#     permission: 'playerparticles.group.group-name'
#     allow-permission-override: true
#     1:
#         effect: 'dust'
#         style: 'wings'
#         data: '255 255 255'
#     2: 
#         effect: 'cloud'
#         style: 'overhead'
#         data: ''
#
# What everything means:
# group-name: The name of the group, how it will be applied by using /pp group load <group-name>.
# display-name: The display name of the group, how it will show up in the GUI, this is required.
# gui-icon: The icon to use for the GUI, this is required.
# permission: The permission that the player must have to see this group, may be left blank as ''. The player must still have permission for all effects/styles within the group in order to use it.
# allow-permission-override: Allow the player to see and apply the group even if they don't have access to all the effects/styles within it. This does nothing if the permission is set to ''. 
# 1 (or any positive whole number n): The particle ID. You may have as many of these as you want, they must contain an effect, style, and data property below them. 
# effect: The effect that the particle will have.
# style: The style that the particle will have.
# data: The data that the particle will have.
#
