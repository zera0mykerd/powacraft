# Define the maximum ping that a player would need to be classified as a low or medium priority.
# Ping rates are measured in (ms).
# Do not change this if you are not sure what you are doing.
Priorities:
  LOW:
    Max Ping: 150
  MEDIUM:
    Max Ping: 300

# This sets for the cooldown (ms) necessary between block breaks for this plugin to begin updating nearby blocks for the player
# The sensitivity is organized by priority.
# Priorities (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) are determined based off of the player's ping.
# A player with good ping will be considered low priority for the plugin for example.
# Players with high ping rates will be more likely to experience more frequent ghost blocks

# Smaller Number = Optimizes performance in exchange for accuracy
# Unit: Milliseconds
Block Break Sensitivity:
  LOW: 150
  MEDIUM: 300
  HIGH: 650

# Block Update Radius (from player)
# Smaller Number = Improved Server Performance (less resource intensive)

# Visual Bug Fix
# Reported on 1.8 clients
# This is not related to the ghost block fix but rather a visual chunk bug that occurs while
# changing worlds or connecting to the server within the first several seconds.
